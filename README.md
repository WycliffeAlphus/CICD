# CI/CD "Hello World" Pipeline


##  Purpose

Set up a minimal CI/CD workflow that:

- Tests the presence of `"Hello World"` in the main HTML file

- Deploys to GitHub Pages only if the test passes

- Demonstrates how automated checks enforce quality before deployment


## Thought Process

DevOps Principles Followed:

- **Automation** -	 Used GitHub Actions to automate build, test, and deploy

- **Quality gates** - 	Required test pass before deployment

- **Transparency** - Logged each step of the process in GitHub Actions

- **Fail fast** -	Deployment blocked immediately if content doesn't match expectations

##  CI/CD Workflow Definition
Added the file `.github/workflows/test-and-deploy.yml` with the workflow definition.

## üî¥ Step 1: Trigger a Failed Deployment

Added a broken index.html (missing "Hello World"):

What happens:

‚úÖ test job runs

‚ùå It fails because "Hello World" is missing

üö´ deploy job is skipped

## Step 2: Fix the Issue and Deploy 

Note that the test now passes and it gets to the `deploy` job.

However, we get an error meaning that the GitHub Pages is not yet enabled or properly configured to deploy using GitHub Actions.

We fix that in github settings:

Then rerun the job:
`Go to Actions ‚Üí Click on the failed run ‚Üí Re-run jobs`

The deployment is now a success.
